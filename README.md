## Inspiration

In this digital age where photos often stay trapped in our phones, my wife and I missed the experience of flipping through physical photo albums with our families. We have fond memories of sitting together, comparing photos, and knowing exactly when each moment was captured thanks to those iconic orange timestamps. Now that we have kids of our own, we wanted to recreate that same feeling - bringing back the charm of dated photos for creating new physical albums that our children can explore and cherish.
